lyrics: '<p>[Verse 1]<br>Shakey threw a party that lasted all night<br>Everybody drank a lot of something nice<br>There was an old fashioned band of married men<br>Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so<br>The ladies looked bad but the music was sad<br>No one took their eyes off Lorraine<br>She shimmied and she strolled like a Chicago moll<br>Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so<br>Yea! it was time to unfreeze<br>When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees<br>Slam! so it wasn&#039;t a game<br>Cracking all the mirrors in shame<br><br>[Chorus]<br>Watch that man!<br>Oh honey, watch that man<br>He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon<br>Watch that man!<br>Oh honey, watch that man<br>He walks like a jerk but he&#039;s only taking care of the room<br>Must be in tune<br><br>[Verse 2]<br>A&nbsp;Benny Goodman&nbsp;fan&nbsp;painted holes in his hands<br>So Shakey&nbsp;hung him up to dry<br>The pundits were joking, the manholes were smoking<br>And every bottle battled with the reason why<br>The girl on the phone wouldn&#039;t leave me alone<br>A throw back from someone&#039;s LP<br>A lemon in a bag played the Tiger Rag<br>And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding<br>Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf<br>For I couldn&#039;t understand the conversation<br>Yeah! I ran to the street<br>Looking for information<br></p><p>[Chorus]<br>Watch that man!<br>Oh honey, watch that man<br>He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon<br>Watch that man!<br>Oh honey, watch that man<br>He walks like a jerk but he&#039;s only taking care of the room<br>Must be in tune<br><br>[Outro]<br>Watch that man<br>Watch that man<br>Watch that man<br>Watch that man</p>'
